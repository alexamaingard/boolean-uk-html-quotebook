                            "The brain appears to possess a special area which we might call poetic memory and which

                            with a metaphor. Which is to say, love begins at the point when a woman enters her first word 
                            into our poetic memory."

                            Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. 
                            And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every 
                            second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.

                            oceans of the unknown. They signify that the cartographers knew they did not know, and 
                            awareness of ignorance is not just ignorance; it's awareness of knowledge's limits."
